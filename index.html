  <h1>Old vs New Income Tax Regime (FY 2025–26)</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Understanding the Old Tax Regime</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Old Tax Regime</strong> under the Indian Income Tax Act for FY 2025–26 is designed to reward taxpayers who actively invest and plan their finances using various tax-saving instruments. It allows individuals to reduce their taxable income significantly by claiming a wide range of <strong>income tax deductions</strong> and <strong>exemptions</strong>.</p>

    <p>Under this regime, taxpayers can take advantage of benefits like the <strong>Standard Deduction</strong> of ₹50,000, deductions under <strong>Section 80C</strong> (up to ₹1.5 lakh for LIC, PPF, ELSS, etc.), <strong>Section 80D</strong> (health insurance premiums), <strong>House Rent Allowance (HRA)</strong>, <strong>Leave Travel Allowance (LTA)</strong>, <strong>home loan interest under Section 24</strong>, and many more.</p>

    <p>This tax structure is especially useful for salaried individuals or those with housing loans and medical expenses, as it offers flexibility in <strong>tax planning</strong> and encourages long-term savings. For anyone who maximizes these deductions, the Old Tax Regime often results in lower overall tax liability compared to the new system.</p>

    <h2>Understanding the New Tax Regime (FY 2025–26)</h2>
    <p>The <strong>New Tax Regime</strong> for FY 2025–26 is aimed at simplifying the income tax structure by offering reduced tax rates and minimizing the need for tax-saving investments. It is an attractive option for individuals who prefer convenience and do not wish to claim multiple deductions or exemptions.</p>

    <p>Taxpayers under the new regime can benefit from a <strong>Standard Deduction</strong> of ₹75,000, but most other deductions like 80C (investments in LIC, PPF, ELSS), 80D (health insurance), HRA, LTA, etc., are not applicable. The system is straightforward and favors those with fewer financial commitments or those who prefer liquidity over locking funds into long-term savings schemes.</p>

    <p>Additionally, the <strong>Section 87A rebate</strong> has been extended up to an annual income of ₹12 lakh, with a maximum rebate of ₹60,000, making income up to ₹12 lakh effectively tax-free for eligible taxpayers. This makes the New Regime highly beneficial for mid-income earners who do not rely heavily on deductions.</p>
